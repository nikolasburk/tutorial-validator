import { Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In this step, you're going to introduce a [sync](/reference/syncing/) backend. This sync backend will:

- Have a "live connection" (via WebSockets) to _all_ the clients that are running your app.
- Propagate events to _all_ other clients whenever a particular client emits an event.

Notice how you'll achieve this by _only_ changing the data layer of your application! 

You won't need to touch the code that you've already written in `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`—all the syncing is handled by LiveStore under the hood without you needing to worry about it in your application code.

You're going to implement the sync backend using [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), using the [@livestore/sync-cf](/reference/syncing/sync-provider/cloudflare/) package.

## Install the Cloudflare sync provider package

Run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">

  <TabItem label="bun">

    <Code code={`bun add @livestore/sync-cf@0.4.0-dev.14`} lang="sh" />

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="pnpm">

    <Code code={`pnpm add @livestore/sync-cf@0.4.0-dev.14`} lang="sh" />

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Create the sync backend

Now, create a new `sync` directory and a new file for the sync backend:

```bash
mkdir src/sync
touch src/sync/client-ws.ts
```

Now, add the following code to it:

```ts title="src/sync/client-ws.ts"
import { makeDurableObject } from '@livestore/sync-cf/cf-worker'
import type { CfTypes } from '@livestore/sync-cf/cf-worker'
import * as SyncBackend from '@livestore/sync-cf/cf-worker'

export class SyncBackendDO extends makeDurableObject({
  onPush: async (message, context) => {
    console.log('client-ws.ts: onPush', message, context)
  },
  onPull: async (message, context) => {
    console.log('client-ws.ts: onPull', message, context)
  },
}) {}

export default {
  async fetch(request: CfTypes.Request, _env: SyncBackend.Env, ctx: CfTypes.ExecutionContext) {
    const searchParams = SyncBackend.matchSyncRequest(request)
    console.log('client-ws.ts: fetch in  with searchParams', searchParams)
    if (searchParams !== undefined) {
      return SyncBackend.handleSyncRequest({
        request,
        searchParams,
        ctx,
        syncBackendBinding: 'SYNC_BACKEND_DO',
      })
    }

    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
  },
}
```

This code will be deployed as a Durable Object (think of it as a "Cloudflare Worker with WebSocket capabilities and attached storage").

In this tutorial, you won't need to go beyond the following basic boilerplate code for syncing. 

However, in more advanced scenarios, there are way for you to hook into the connection between your client apps and the sync backend. This could e.g. be useful when your app requires authentication and you need to send along an auth token.

Next, you need to slightly modify the code for your LiveStore web worker in `/src/livestore/livestore.worker.ts`:

```diff title="/src/livestore/livestore.worker.ts" lang="ts"
import { makeWorker } from '@livestore/adapter-web/worker'
+import { makeWsSync } from '@livestore/sync-cf/client'

import { schema } from './schema.ts'

makeWorker({ 
  schema,
+  sync: {
+    backend: makeWsSync({ url: `${location.origin}/sync` }),
+  }
})
```

Finally, you need to update your `wrangler.toml` to ensure Vite and Cloudflare know about the new sync backend:

```diff title="wrangler.toml" lang="toml"
name = "livestore-todo-app"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-28"
+main = "./src/sync/client-ws.ts"
+compatibility_flags = [
+  "nodejs_compat",
+]

[observability]
enabled = true

+[[durable_objects.bindings]]
+name = "SYNC_BACKEND_DO"
+class_name = "SyncBackendDO"

+[[migrations]]
+tag = "v1"
+new_sqlite_classes = ["SyncBackendDO"]
```

Here's a quick rundown of the changes:

- `main`: Since you're now introducing a "backend", your app needs to be reconfigured. It now has a dedicated entry point in `./src/sync/client-ws.ts`. When your Worker receives a request, this file's exported handlers are executed. In your case, it points to the WebSocket sync backend implementation.
- `durable_objects.bindings`: This configures the bindings for your Durable Object. You'll be able to inspect it in the Cloudflare Dashboard by its name `SYNC_BACKEND_DO`.
- `migrations`: Whenever you introduce a new Durable Object that supports [SQLite storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#create-sqlite-backed-durable-object-class) (or update an existing one), you need to add a migration referencing the new or updated Durable Object class. 

You're now ready to run and deploy the app:

  <TabItem label="pnpm">

Feel free to test the new behaviour locally or using the deployed version. This time, data syncing will work across browsers and even devices!

Here's a GIF demonstrating how a regular Chrome tab, an incognito Chrome tab and a Safari tab are staying in sync automatically:
